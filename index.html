<p>We started a Facebook group page named 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/682323215235912/" target="blank_"> the "Vanderbilt University QuarkNet" group.</a>  
It is a "closed group"
account, which means that Bill has to allow your membership.  We want all the QuarkNet teachers
in our area to belong.  Since it works with Facebook accounts, many, most, all might want to 
create a Facebook account just for their school QuarkNet (and other science?) activities.

<p> In progress. </p>

<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2016</h2></font></p>

<p>Following our tradition, we had several talks by local experts, on the LHC, CMS physics and computing, Mapping
the Universe, and CMS Forward Pixel upgrade.  Thanks to Andrew Melo, Andreas Berlind, and Will Johns for the very
interesting talks and discussion.  Bill talked after lunch introducing Gravitational Waves, mostly about the sources
and the nature of the Quadrupole formula for gravitational radiation.</p>

<p>Tuesday and Wednesday were all about the LIGO eLab---looking at the data from the Hanford and Livingston seismometers.
Ken Cecire form Notre Dame and national QuarkNet led the two day workshop.  It was interesting to correlate data with
earth quakes and other events.  Checkout the "agenda" link below and especially the "Info on frequency bands" that
appears.  This is from Dale Ingram who also gave us and two other institutions a virtual tour of Hanford LIGO.</p>

<p>Thursday was all about a day trip to Marshall Space Flight Center (and the U.S. Space and Rocke Center) in 
Huntsville, AL.  We were hosted by Scott Anderson, who looks like a great contact for teachers---free stuff was
mentioned as well as teacher space camps with the possibility of funding/grants to attend!  We heard from Trey
Cate, the deputy communications person, about the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA's new heavy lift vehicle.  The discussed
the distant retrograde orbit on the far-side of the moon for construction of the Mars space craft and rocket.  He
also discussed the Orion crew module that can sit on top of the SLS.  We had a bus tour after lunch to see Marshall itself
and hear about the history.  One stop was the Payload Operations and Integration Center, where we visitors could look
at operators in the control room guiding and monitoring science experiments on the International Space Station.</p>

<p>Friday seemed to be all about throwing bottles of water that had a leaking hole cut in their sides.  But actually
it started with Terry King guiding us through the construction of two fun LIGO/Gravitation demos...the spandex warped
spacetime, and the tennis ball merging like blackholes.  Very Fun!  We also assembled the Cosmic Ray Muon Detector and
looked at the Equip program, to refresh our memories.  The last thing we did was to throw leaking water bottles at
Bill and Meaghan from a spiral staircase.  By-the-way, they do not leak the whole time...somethink to do with the 
equivalence principle.
</p>

<p> Great Week! Thanks to our speakers, to Ken, and to the teachers that make it interesting.</p>

<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2015</h2></font></p>

<p>The week began, as we like to, with several talks in the morning until just after lunch
describing the status of the CMS detector on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, also
on physics analysis and on astronomy/astrophysics.  Dr. Gabella talked about the
LHC, CMS, and later Cosmic Rays.  He also described the speed-of-muons (of-light) experiment,
a favorite of Dr. Gabella and Dr. Webster.  "Almost Dr." Delannoy did a fine
job describing the new physics results and the hopes for new data.  Dr. Rudy Montez represented
the astro group and talked about exoplanets and his field, stellar evolution.
</p>

<p>We also took a moment in the morning to remember Tom Jordan who passed away this year.</p>

</p></p>

<p>Monday afternoon was spent checking out the four sets of cosmic ray
muon detectors---the three that Vanderbilt loans out and one borrowed
from Diana Giante from Bowling Green, KY.  Four old but good laptops
were donated by Vanderbilt University and Gabella installed Fedora
Linux.  They ran the Equip control program fine and served very nicely
as the DAQ computer.  The teachers set the CRMDs up as speed-of-light
experiments.
</p>  

<p>Tuesday and Wednesday, we had another visit from Bob Peterson from
Fermilab "Central" QuarkNet group.  Always good to see Bob and be
reminded and aided in all the ways we can use e-Lab.  He took us
through two days of experiments and e-Lab tools, especially focusing on
shower mode.</p>

<p>Our special event this year was a visit on Thursday from a summer program at Vanderbilt
University called Vanderbilt Science Academy for high school students.  This class focused
on Galaxies and Large Scale Structure and met for three weeks during the summer.  Their
instructer was Dr. Erika Grundstrom who kindly allowed us to "practice" on the children.
The students prepared by reading and discussing "Cosmic Extremes" and other units or
measurement useful in the study of cosmic ray muons.</p>

<p> We divided the students into 3-4 person teams with two teachers
each.  Each team was responsible for one CRMD and took data to
calculate the speed-of-muons.  They manipulated the hardware, setting
up in telescope mode, and trying to separate the upper pair from the
lower by as much distance as possible in the lab.  They also took data
in normal ordering, and then to eliminate the systematics in the
swapped order.  We used a program of Dr. Websters to create the
spreadsheet datafile and the students then analyzed them either in
Google Sheet (preferred) or with any other spreadsheet program the
wanted to use.  Our teams did very well, actually finding the speed-of-muons
to be about the speed-of-light to within 3%---or they found the speed-of-light
to within 3%.
</p>

<p>This seemed to be a big success for both the teachers and the students.  Quarknet teachers
were able to see this somewhat simple, with the complexity of the swapped scintillators,
few hour exercise and how the students would do with experiment.  The students seemed to 
understand that there was a "trick" here of swapping the detectors and it was necessary to 
create data that made any sense.  Unclear how many students really understood why this was
done---we believe that takes a little time and rumination.  They students were rewarded with 
a good measurement of the speed-of-light.
</p>

<p>Friday found use debriefing about Thursdays teaching experience, creating a summary document
of the speed-of-light experiment, and filling out the survey forms.


<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2014</h2></font></p>
<p> We started the week with a set of talks on the status of the Large
Hadron Collider at CERN, the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment,
the ongoing physics analysis coming out of CMS, and an
astronompy/astrophysics talk on the Bicep2 result possible seeing
effects of gravity waves from the Big Bang.  Thanks to our speakers:
Dr. Will Johns, (proto-doctor) Andres Delannoy, and (proto-doctor) Jen
Piscionere.  In the afternoon, we went through the "time-of-flight"
(aka speed-of-light, or speed-of-muons) experiment where data can be
analyzed from a spreadsheet.</p>

<p> We had two visitors from Quarknet "Central," Ken Cecire of Purdue University and
Bob Peterson of Fermilab.  Bob ran the Tuesday and Wednesday sessions with a focus
on the Cosmic Ray e-Lab and the importance of uploaded data.  We culminated that 
effort with presentations in the online CR e-Lab way, and finally with teachers
being teachers and uploading a "lesson plan" like document.</p>

<p> On Thursday we had a field trip to Dyer Observatory where we were guided 
through astornomy by Dr. Billy Teets and Dr. Bob Schweikert.  We say the camera
obscura aptly named the Star Chamber, we learned much about sun dials (finally
understanding those odd hyperbolic lines above and below the actual scale), we
made icy, dirty, chemically snowballs, and we say great images of the sun through
a modest-sized telescope with a filter.</p>

<p> On Friday we hit the roads to visit Jere Matty at the STEM Center at Arnold
Engineering and Development Center.  We tried out had at wind tunnels, metered
"stomp rockets," and entered the inflatable planetarium.  We lunched at UT-Space
Institute's "The View" cafeteria, uh, with a great view of the reservoir and good,
interesting food.  Dr. Bill Hofmeister was able to spend time with us and show us 
around the Center for Laser Applicationas as well as demonstrate freezing water in
a vacuum chamber.</p>

<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2013</h2></font></p>
<p>
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN continues to produce
collisions at the highest energies ever studied in detail and the additional
data has convinced most people that the Higgs has been found.  We will
review this progress.</p>
<p> Supporting evidence for time dilation (twin paradox to sci-fi 
 aficionados) was first obtained by comparing cosmic ray fluxes at different
altitudes in Colorado.  We repeated this classic experiment by comparing
the flux in Nashville with the flux on Mt. Mitchell in North Carolina.  We
started the week at Webster's house for low altitude runs, moved to Mt.
Mitchell for high altitude runs, and returned to the Vandy physics building
to compare the rates and see if we need to invoke time dilation to explain
our data.  We have posted  our <A href="./sch2013.html"> detailed plan,</A>
pictures, power points, and a paper describing our work. </p>

<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2012</h2></font></p>
<p>  Our 2012 program featured gravity and updates on CERN - LHC physics.
Work on the web site is still in progress and only a 
 <A href="./sch2012.html">sumary</A> is available here.</p>
<p>Med took some great <a href="http://www.hep.vanderbilt.edu/~webstems/LIGO"> 
photos </a> of LIGO Livingston where Brian O'Reilly (aka Irish)
was a wonderful tour guide.</p>


<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2011</h2></font></p>
<p>  Two of our teachers went to the "Fermilab Boot camp" to analyze fresh
data from CERN.  Our local effort was divided between a workshop on using the
e-lab facilities to analyze data from our Cosmic Ray Detector units and a
session on the history of nuclear fission.  We caped off our study of fission
with a visit to Oak Ridge, where a vital part of that history took place.
Our <A href="./sch2011.html">2011 agenda</A> includes links to
the power point presentations and photos of our local sessions on analysis
of data from our muon counters and from our Oak Ridge expedition.</p>

<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2010</h2></font></p>
<p>  Our representative from the national Quarknet office helped us welcome six
new participants this year and we began with discussions of the history and
status of particle physics to help orient the newcomers.  Ken (from the national
office) also introduced us to masterclasses and proposed that we consider one
this fall.  Our <A href="./sch2010.html">2010 agenda</A> includes links to
the power point presentations from several speakers and photos of our session
on construction and use of our group's muon counters.</p>

<p><font color="blue"><h2>Vandy Quarknet 2009</h2></font></p>
<p> We started with coffee and presentations from each teacher on
how the muon counters were used in her/his classroom and generally how
particle physics and cosmology were worked into the curriculum.
Webster discussed a new counter presently under construction to help
visualize the passage of cosmic rays.  This counter will use proportional
tubes.  A distinguishing feature of proportional tubes is the very fine wire
down the axis of the tube and Webster  explained why the center wire
must be so small.  Each teacher had an
opportunity to  <A href="./index_files/2009_07_29_IMG_1729.JPG">measure</A>
 the tension in the central wire of a tube and
the prototype, still lacking electronics, was on display to help show
how LEDs mounted near the ends of each prop tube will show the path of
cosmic rays.  Our scintillator muon counter systems are used for real
measurements during the summer vacation and we visited the observatory
dome where our two muon counters are
<A href="./index_files/2009_06_11_IMG_1339c.JPG">in use</A> to measure the East-West
asymmetry of the cosmic ray flux. Sean Nomoto summarized the data and
conclusions thus far obtained.</p>

 <p>   We illustrated the role of a small group in the large CMS (Compact
Muon Solenoid - one of the principal detectors at the LHC (Large Hadron
Collider, just starting up at CERN in Geneva , Switzerland))
collaboration by showing how Vanderbilt participates.  Comments from
the teachers confirm that detailing such local participation is
essential to help them believe that we (collectively) have a real part
in the LHC.  Our on-site effort will include data transport, storage,
and processing on Vanderbilt facilities while we maintain an active
role at the detector in CERN.  Webster illustrated the Moore's Law
like growth of storage from the 80 Byte punched "IBM card" a couple of
decades ago through disks of a few GBytes common on PCs today.  Dan
Engh described how even the multi-Terabyte disks today are inadequate
for LHC data volumes and explained how both data storage and computing
power from many institutions will be harnessed through the internet to
efficiently process the LHC data.  Paul Sheldon set up and Zhiao Shi
led a tour of the 1000 CPU Vanderbilt cluster which will contribute to
the storage and reduction of CMS data.  Will Johns joined us from CERN
by teleconferencing to explain the on-site work the Vanderbilt team is
doing to prepare for beam and gave us some inside hints on progress
toward colliding protons.</p>

</p>  We concluded our on-campus sessions with a discussion of how we
expect to have computer reconstruction and visualization of real events
for our workshop next summer.</p>

 <p>  The final two days were in Boulder, Colorado for tours of the NIST (National
Institute of Science and Technology, Department of Commerce), NCAR (National
Center for Atmospheric Research, National Science foundation),
and  NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of
Commerce) labs.  Highlights of the tours were:</p>

   <p>Our <A href="./index_files/2009_07_30_IMG_1749.JPG">NCAR tour</A>
started in the rain.  Inside we saw the racks of CPUs
comprising the computer which runs the weather analysis and prediction
programs, some of the apparatus for acquiring the data needed for the
computation, and numerous clever demonstrations to illustrate the
formation of clouds and tornadoes. Our guide was very knowledgeable <A href=
"./index_files/2009_07_30_IMG_1764.JPG">and here</A> makes a point about
climate change. </p>

   <p>At NIST we saw the frequency standard which
adjusts the clock that defines world time and our guide demonstrated
numerous low temperature (liquid nitrogen) effects.</p>

<p> <A href="./index_files/2009_07_31_IMG_1813c.JPG"> At  NOAA </A>
(Department of Commerce) our tour concentrated on weather prediction
and the use of the results from the NCAR computers for forecasting.</p>

<p> The <A href="./index_files/2009_07_30_IMG_1778.JPG">beautiful Rockies </A>
 were in the background for all this, so one
afternoon after our tour we bought some sandwiches in Estes park and
headed up toward the Continental Divide in Rocky Mountain National
Park.  The fog (Or was it a cloud?) was so dense that we did not make
it to the divide but did enjoy
our <A href="./index_files/2009_07_30_IMG_1793c.JPG">dinner </A>of sandwiches in magnificent surroundings.</p>

<p>Our 2008 Quarknet week started at Vandy with Bob Peterson (Quarknet at FNAL)
 and Beth Marchant (Quarknet staff at Notre Dame) helping our local group
 with the assembly of our second muon counter.   Brenda Pless (Blackman High
School) and Bob Peterson <A href="./index_files/2008_06_02_IMG_0739c.JPG">

<A href="index_files/2008_06_02_IMG_0746c.JPG">  checking coincidences  </A>
between our two sets of counters.  The larger new counters are on the wooden
platform.  One pair of the older set is on the board above and the other on the
table beneath, so that a muon through all four of the small scintillators
had to go through the larger new scintillators.  The GPS of each set of counters records the
time at which a signal is received from its scintillator paddles and these
times are the same within a few nanoseconds for a muon which passes through all
the paddles.  Hits on all four small paddles with no coincidence from the
larger paddles would indicate inefficiency of the large paddles.
</p>
<p> We spent the final day of our 2008 Quarknet week at Brookhaven National 
Laboratory.  The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider - RHIC - was off 
for maintenance so our group was able to go inside the 
<A href="index_files/2008_06_06_IMG_0776c.JPG">  tunnel </A> where our
guide, Christoph Montag, described how the machine works.  Inside that pipe
on the left is a magnet and the vacuum tubes for the two streams (beams) of
lead or gold ions going in opposite directions.
  <A href="index_files/2008_06_06_IMG_0778c.JPG">  A display model </A> 
shows these tubes and the liquid helium connections.  The physics
discoveries at these machines are made by measuring the fragments produced
when ions from the two streams collide.  Large detectors such as the
<A href="index_files/2008_06_06_IMG_0789c.JPG"> PHENIX detector</A> are
 needed to measure the fragments.  Brant Johnson is one of the leading
physicists in the work with PHENIX and is shown here explaining the
parts of the detector to our group.  The parts were separated for maintenance
work at the time of our visit so we were able to see much more of the internal
pieces.  </p>

<p> Our Quarknet group touring the 
<A href="index_files/2008_06_06_IMG_0781c.JPG"> muon g-2 experiment.</A>  That
 white circular object is part of a circular ring in which magnets bend a beam
of muons into a circle.  The muons are like tiny bar magnets which are
twisted (rotated) by the magnetic field.  Measurements of the angle of the
electron emitted when the muon decays measure the twist and hence
the strength of that tiny bar magnet.  In the 1960s this building
was the home of the large bubble chamber in which the Omega minus was
discovered, giving credibility to the foundations of the Standard Model.</p>

Guide </A> at the muon g-2 experiment, showing us one of the
precision magnetic field measuring devices used in the experiment while
Aimee (her camera is barely visible in the lower left corner) takes a picture 
of it - a picture she will show to her class.</p>


<p> Setting up at <A href="index_files/2008_12_01_IMG_1129cc.JPG"> Brenda's
classroom</A> at Blackman with help from three
students.  One pair of scintillators is on the table and the other pair is

<p>Nick Horton (Riverdale), far right and his
<A href="index_files/2007_05_17_IMG_0179_m.JPG"> class</A>, May 17,
2007.  The muon counter is set up on the table and shelf by the young
man's elbow. The cable to the Gps unit is strung over the emergency shower 
and out the door behind them.  Nick set up the counter with the
<A href="index_files/2007_05_17_IMG_0174_m.JPG"> GPS mounted on his wind
vane and anemometer</A> on the roof.  Luke Nowaki, the student in front of
Nick measured the speed of cosmic rays by comparing timing with
the upper counters two feet above the lower pair as shown with the timing
when the upper counter is mounted up in the ceiling.  Luke also
visited us at Vanderbilt to measure the lifetime of the muon using one
of our advanced lab setups.</p>

<p>We went to the National Radio Observatory at Greenbank.  No gasoline
vehicles (spark plugs!) and no digital cameras are allowed near the telescopes
because the electrical noise such electronic devices generate upsets
the radio telescopes. The huge Robert C. Byrd Green Bank radio telescope is
 in the background behind
<A href="index_files/picture3.jpg"> our group</A>, and a closer view of the  
<A href="index_files/picture2.jpg">telescope</A> shows the detailed structure.
We actually got to operate one of the smaller telescopes.  Our guide makes
a preliminary adjustment before each of our teachers actually ran the
<A href="index_files/picture1.jpg">telescope</A> to measure the differential
rotation of our galaxy.</p>

students also measured the attenuation by marshmallows.</p>
